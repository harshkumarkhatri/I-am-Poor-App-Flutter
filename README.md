# i_am_poor

This is a Flutter app which do nothing except for displaying an image on the scree. I was inspired by the I am Rich app which was placed at price of $999.99 on playstore and was was doing nothing except for displaying an image.<br>
The things which are done in this app involve:-
* MaterialApp design.
* Scaffold class.
* Appbar
* Asset Image
* Icon and name changing.
Note:- I have used appicon.co for generating my icons from a photo.
